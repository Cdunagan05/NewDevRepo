        <p>In west Midland, Texas, born and raised, on the soccer field is where I spend most of my days.
          Overheating outside and definitely not staying cool, shooting some soccer balls out by the school,
          when a couple of guys came up and just said something about making trouble with what we had. </p>
        <p>I decided that what was needed, was that I should kick the soccer ball into the goal, and then run
          around like I had just won the World Cup.  It was pretty fun. </p>
