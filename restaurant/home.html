       Riga is the newest, hippest diner to come to Austin, Texas. We pride ourselves on serving our biggest
       customers, sixteen to thirty-five year old hipsters. We only serve the newest food, discovered by
       researchers exploring the eating habits of human beings who lived back in the years of 1980-1995.
       You better get on this train before it leaves the station, because once a menu item becomes too popular,
       it's deleted from the menu.  That meal was so last year. So if you just got back into rock groups like
       Ace of Base and Tame Impala, then come down and enjoy a rad meal with some Topo Loco to drink.
